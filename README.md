# Random Generator
Create a random generator class which takes as input a seed of numbers and their
associated probabilities. Implement the method nextNum() and a minimal but effective set of
unit tests. The method nextNum() should only ever return one of the seeded numbers and
given enough calls the probability of the output should converge on the seed probability
